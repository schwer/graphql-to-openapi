Welcome! If you would like to submit a pull-request, please
follow the following guidelines.

- Limit your changes to those relevant to an existing issue.
- If an issue doesn't yet exist, please create one first.
- Do not update the package.json or .version file unless explicitly invited to.
- Do your best to follow the implicit style-guidelines in each file.
- Because the capabilities provided by this module are limited in scope,
  we target 100% code coverage in our testing suite. Please add tests
  for any new capability you add to the package's scope.

There are a variety of test-automation actions that will need
to pass for a pull-request to be merged. `npm run lint` and `npm run testall`
will reveal most issues before those test-automation actions
complain.
